                <p>The Glass element is not misnamed, strictly speaking – it is
                    used primarily to control glass – but strictly speaking, it controls
                    any pure non-metallic amorphous substance. This means that
                    it can also exert control over a large number of strange and
                    not at all glass-like things – gels, resins, a number of
                    different kinds of plastics, thin films, some wax… many
                    Glass-elements go through their entire lives not knowing the
                    full extent of their abilities – not because they contain some
                    great, secret power, but because the exact nature of the Glass
                    element is just so weird. Like the other coarse manipulation
                    elements, it functions on a range of objects around median temperature – in this
                    case, around 50°C above or below it. Unlike many others, it really doesn’t care
                    about the state of matter that the substance is in.
                    Glass-elements need to get creative – there’s only so far you can go by
                    flinging broken windows at people. Some Glass-elements have demonstrated the
                    ability to alter the state of controlled matter, allowing them to “un-break”
                    shattered glass. As the ages have passed, Glass-elements have found themselves
                    making increasing use of their ability to control many kinds of plastic as well.
                    Glass-elements also typically have very, very good fine control of their element –
                    perhaps to make up for a weak range, which often only extends to 20m. A typical
                    Glass-element can control about 500kg of matter at once.
                    Glass-elements are typically quiet but not withdrawn, are aesthetically
                    minded, and have a keen appreciation of details. They can be visionary without
                    coming across as unreasonable, and can be quite sensitive people if they turn that
                    eye for detail towards others. At their worst, they can turn that eye for detail
                    towards others’ faults, becoming picky, pedantic, or arrogant. Appropriately, they
                    often manifest sensory or support powers. Glass is an uncommon element,
                    accounting for a bit less than 3% of elementalists.</p>
