                <p>The Fire element creates and maintains
                    non-ionized flames. Exertion of the Fire element
                    can be used as a kind of fuel that sustains burning,
                    and can also be used to trigger oxidization if enough
                    heat is not present. The limits of the Fire element
                    are well-defined but don’t often impede a Fireelement’s ability to do things. Generally, flames
                    created by a Fire-element cannot be less than 1500°C, though, as usual, skilled
                    elementalists can push this limit down if they want to. The main restriction of the
                    Fire element is that it works solely on gasses undergoing oxidization, so
                    controlling a smouldering substance like an ember is not possible. It is impossible
                    to tell what the ideal temperature for controlling fire is, because it seems to have
                    an upper limit that’s well above what can be reached without a state shift – the
                    more ionized oxygen atoms there are in the flame, the harder it is for a Fireelement to control and the easier it is for a Plasma-element to control. A relatively
                    small percentage of ionized atoms will significantly impede a fire-element’s
                    capacity to exert control over the remaining non-ionized atoms, which means
                    exceptionally hot flames can become impossible to control not because the state
                    is homogenously wrong, but because there is too much interference from a nongaseous state.
                    Fire-elements can create fires or extinguish them, and can direct preexisting flames in directions of their choosing. As is typically for Transformative
                    Manipulation Elements, a Fire-element can direct flames at a range of up to 20m
                    but can only create flames in spaces that are extremely close to them – oftentimes
                    restricted to within 30cm. Fire-elements can also direct thermal energy away from
                    themselves so long as it’s through a gaseous medium, which means that while a
                    Fire-element can stop their own powers from burning them, if they touch a
                    combusting substance in a non-gaseous state (i.e. an ember or superheated
                    plasma), they will burn like a normal person. Like a Lightning-element, Fireelements need to exert elemental energy to stop themselves from burning, which 
                    35
                    means if they are subject to enough fire they can also be burnt. Typically, a Fireelement will instinctively avoid exerting so much energy that they create a flame
                    they can’t stop from burning them, but it is possible to create a flame so big or
                    hot that they burn themselves.
                    Fire-elements are typically focused, quiet, creative people inclined to feel
                    strong emotions but not to show them in easily identifiable ways. This isn’t
                    because they’re afraid of seeming vulnerable – they just process and express
                    feelings in a different way. At their best they can be creative, driven, and
                    emotionally intelligent people, but they can also moody or apathetic if they isolate
                    themselves. Fire-elements manifest a very wide array of auxiliary powers, and are
                    the most common transformative manipulation element, accounting for a bit over
                    8% of total elementalists.</p>
