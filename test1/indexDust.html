                <p>Dust is the most common of the Quasi-Elements, though
                    it is still rarer than any non-Quasi-Element. The DustElement destroys matter within a rigidly defined area,
                    breaking it down into miniscule pieces that often look
                    like grains of sand. A Dust-element will focus on an
                    area that they wish to disintegrate. A translucent,
                    cuboid lattice of light will appear around that area.
                    When the lattice is fully formed, it will briefly turn
                    into an opaque cuboid, and then fade, leaving a fine
                    powder behind. Dust-elements can form this lattice
                    faster the smaller it is, though most find making miniscule
                    lattices also quite difficult. They can increase the speed/size of this lattice by
                    creating it closer to themselves – though this is of limited utility, because they
                    typically have a very small range to begin with – rarely over 5m. Dust is noticeable
                    for being totally unaffected by IWC.
                    Dust-elements are typically dreamy, romantic people, who act on their
                    feelings in the long-term. They aren’t necessarily impulsive, but they don’t put
                    much effort into understanding why they want the things that they want. They can
                    be creative and friendly if they keep themselves a bit grounded, and awkward and
                    insensitive if they don’t. There aren’t enough Dust-elements to determine what
                    kind of auxiliary power they’re inclined to manifest – they consist of around .7%
                    of elementalists. </p>
