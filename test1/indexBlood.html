                <p>The Blood element has an intimidating name, but in practice
                    is one of the most, if not the most, passive of the elements. Blood
                    controls living organic matter that is linked to a brain, and,
                    because of IWC, cannot be used on unwilling people. While
                    Psionics-elements can detect things going on in a brain
                    without having to exert control over it, Blood-elements
                    are faced with a significantly less complicate, and
                    consequently less telling, object of focus – the body.
                    Blood-elements can detect living, sentient beings at about the
                    same range a Psionics-element can, but can get no further
                    information beyond a general sense of that being’s physical
                    condition. Blood-elements exert control over cells in the same way Plantelements do, but have a drastically lowered capacity for coarse manipulation, with
                    most Blood-elements being limited at a mere 200kg.
                    This is not that much of an impediment, though, as Blood-elements
                    largely care about the details of the body. While IWC prevents them from
                    controlling others, there are many situations where somebody would let a Bloodelement control them quite willingly. They can mend injuries far better than
                    somebody with a healing auxiliary power could, and can even reattach severed 
                    40
                    limbs. They can make small modifications to existing organs as well, which, for
                    example, allows them to cure some (but not all) kinds of blindness. They can
                    grow bones, or reshape them painlessly, which some creative elementalists have
                    used to make weapons from their own flesh (this is probably the only
                    circumstance where the Blood element is as creepy as its name implies). Very,
                    very rarely, a Blood-element learns how to repair their own DNA, which stops
                    aging and makes them effectively immortal. If somebody is sufficiently dazed, an
                    extremely strong Blood-element can cause physical damage to them, but even
                    then, the target’s IWC makes causing fatal damage difficult if not impossible.
                    Notably, while a Blood-element can repair nerves, they cannot manipulate the
                    neural system itself, and cannot naturally repair brain injuries – though with the
                    help of a Psionics-element this has been accomplished on rare occasions. They
                    lose control of something within minutes of it dying, but this is long enough that
                    they could throw around the corpse a bit if they wanted. Not many of them do.
                    Blood-elements are typically no-nonsense pragmatists with a strong
                    ethical code that they can often obsess over. This can make them extremely
                    devoted and efficient humanitarians, and predisposes them to a more realistic
                    kind of altruism than the kind that their Plant-element brethren tend towards.
                    However, they can also come across as self-righteous and at times fanatical, and
                    if they somehow develop an ethical code that permits a kind of ends-justify-themeans type of extremism, they can become terrifying and remorselessly cruel
                    people. Even when this happens, they don’t lose faith in a better world – they
                    simply don’t care if they’re the only person who thinks that the world they’re
                    trying to create actually is better than the current one. They often develop
                    auxiliary powers that can be used without anybody noticing. Blood is the rarest
                    “true” element, accounting for less than 1% of elementalists.</p>
