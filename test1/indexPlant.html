                <p>The Plant element, as you might expect,
                    controls mostly plants – though the specifics of what it
                    can control are a bit broader. Plant-elements are
                    well-known to be able to control fungi as well,
                    but strictly speaking, it can control any living
                    organic matter that is not linked to a brain. This
                    means that a Plant-element could theoretically control not
                    just plants and fungi, but also animals like jellyfish, worms,
                    or perhaps even entire hydrozoan colonies. That having been
                    said, all living things have some measure of IWC – it’s just that
                    for plants, IWC is so weak it really doesn’t matter. Animals – even the ones
                    without brains – do have enough IWC to make controlling them difficult, so most
                    Plant-elements stick to plants and fungi. They can manipulate matter on cellular
                    and large-scale levels, with many being able to manipulate a tree’s cell cycle one
                    moment and then rip it out of the ground the next. Their coarse manipulation
                    range is shorter than the other Biotic elements at about 20m, but they can exert
                    control over about 2500kg of matter on average – more than any other element.
                    Plant-elements can levitate, tear, bend or repair matter under their
                    control, and also possess significant control over cellular development. This
                    permits them to expedite or delay growth if they so desire, though they cannot 
                    39
                    create matter from nowhere and consequently need to provide the nutrients that
                    the organism would need to grow themselves. Plant-elements do lose control over
                    matter when it dies, but they lose control by far the slowest out of all the Biotic
                    elements, with some possessing the ability to control things that have been dead
                    for hours or even days.
                    Plant-elements are typically peaceful and introverted, but do love to
                    spend time around people, provided those people come in manageable doses.
                    They can be giving and warm, but under pressure are prone to stubbornness, with
                    a strong inclination to resist courses of action they view as drastic even under
                    circumstances that clearly warrant them. They are also often altruistic to the point
                    of naiveté, and respond quite badly to people doing things they see as immoral
                    or selfish. They don’t get angry, though – just depressed. Like Psionics-elements,
                    they tend to develop auxiliary powers with a strongly physical angle, though these
                    powers typically have to do with altering the state of their own body rather than
                    empowering it to do exceptional things. Plant-elements are rare, making up 3%
                    of all elementalists.</p>
