                <p>The Gravity element is generally
                    regarded as one of the most powerful
                    elements, probably because it comes the
                    closest to true, unconditional telekinesis. It is
                    not complicated – Gravity-elements can
                    increase or decrease the gravity in an area, or
                    rotate the direction in which it pulls. It
                    considers only how far the affected area is from
                    the elementalist, and how large that area is. Most
                    Gravity-elements can use their powers at a distance of around 20m,
                    and on an area about 3m3 at close range. Using the Gravity element is much more
                    taxing than other elements, however – most elementalists cannot maintain an
                    HEA surplus while using it in any way, which means that they will always have to
                    stop using it sooner or later. Many Gravity-elements will prolong their use of it by
                    burning non-elemental energy, which can leave them extremely weak if they aren’t
                    careful.
                    Gravity-elements can levitate themselves and others, send objects flying
                    by rotating the direction that gravity pulls them, pin things down by increasing
                    their weight, walk on walks and ceilings, and force others to walk on walls and
                    ceilings with them – an experience for which few are prepared. Like the other 
                    43
                    Fine Manipulation Elements, Gravity-elements can detect their element at
                    distances further than they can actively manipulate, though for Gravity this ability
                    is not terribly useful, as gravity on Earth tends to stay the same. They can tell when
                    somebody else uses the Gravity element nearby, though, and they have an
                    intuitive ability to appraise objects’ weights at a glance.
                    Gravity-elements tend to be dynamic and outgoing, expecting lots from
                    people and willing to work to help others meet their expectations. They are also
                    typically fun-loving people who work hard to keep their fun far away from any
                    sort of practical application – they are the kind people who think that if your
                    hobby becomes your job, you’ll start to hate it. At their best they can be
                    charismatic leaders who never succumb to self-aggrandizement, but they are also
                    prone to setting unreasonable goals for themselves and others, and are easily
                    disappointed. Because their elemental power puts them below HEA equilibrium
                    so often, they typically develop weak auxiliary powers – or at least, auxiliary
                    powers that require very little energy to use. They are uncommon, accounting for
                    4% of elementalists.</p>
