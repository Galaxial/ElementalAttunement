                <p>The Magnetism element conditionally
                    creates electromagnetic fields. They can be
                    used to magnetically attract or repel things, or
                    to create electromagnetic radiation. The
                    frequency of this radiation is dependant on the
                    elementalist, but lower frequencies tend to be
                    easier to produce. Most Magnetism-elements can
                    create electromagnetic radiation up to 250MHz, though some
                    have been able to create radiation as high-frequency as microwaves.
                    While they theoretically have the capacity to detect and Extremely Low
                    Frequency waves, they do not have the ability to intuitively process them – this
                    ability is restricted to waves above 30MHz.
                    Magnetism-elements’ powers manifest visibly as weaker/less flexible
                    versions of Metal-elements’ powers – they can move magnetic materials around,
                    but only towards them or away from them. The real utility of their power comes
                    in being able to detect low-frequency electromagnetic radiation. They can
                    produce signals that can be interpreted by electronic devices and converted into 
                    44
                    sound, allowing them to create “phantom voices” that exist only on the airwaves
                    and were never spoken by a human. They can block or intercept most wireless
                    communication. They can figure out roughly where a signal is coming from and
                    track it down over great distances. This is all facilitated by a massive amount of
                    intuitive control – Magnetism-elements’ ability to recognize their element is
                    perhaps orders of magnitude stronger than any other element. Magnetismelements can’t simultaneously process more information than, say, a Soundelement, but they can find information faster, oftentimes being able to pick out a
                    single signal to listen to from hundreds of others. Their zone of immediate
                    control is comparatively small – they can easily influence signals within 20m, but
                    most have difficulty beyond that. As with all Transformative Manipulation
                    Elements, they can only emit electromagnetic radiation from their hands. Their
                    zone of intuitive control, however, can be upwards of 5km.
                    Magnetism-elements are often quiet but easygoing – though they can
                    become skittish if they spend too much time listening for signals, this doesn’t
                    seem to be something they’re naturally predisposed to, but rather something that
                    happens to them. They tend to cope with drastic changes well, and while they
                    don’t actively try to suppress their emotions, they aren’t prone to give them too
                    much thought, either. At their best they are friendly, undemanding and levelheaded people, but they can easily slip into apathetic, boring laziness if they don’t
                    stay focused on the people around them. Like Gravity-elements, they don’t often
                    manifest particularly dynamic or demanding auxiliary powers. They are rare,
                    accounting for 3% of total elementalists.</p>
