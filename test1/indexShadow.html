                <p>Like the Light element, the Shadow element has two major
                    components. While Light-elements can generate light,
                    Shadow-elements can absorb it. While Lightelements can order light, Shadow-elements can
                    disorder it. Practically speaking, these two
                    abilities are not as distinct as Light’s two
                    abilities, though they both do have their uses.
                    Shadow-elements have control over a similar
                    range of the frequency spectrum, though they
                    tend to skew a bit towards the lower
                    frequencies. That means that while Lightelements have a harder time producing red than
                    violet, Shadow-elements have a harder time absorbing violet
                    than red. Their controllable frequency range is also slightly larger, and it’s virtually
                    unheard of for a Shadow-element to be unable to interact with visible violet light
                    in the same way some Light-elements can’t interact with red light. They can
                    absorb about the same amount of light a Light-element can produce, though
                    again, their capacity to absorb light is generally a little bit higher than a Lightelement’s capacity to emit it. They can also cause light to scatter, which can be
                    used for defocusing lights and blurring vision.
                    The Shadow element is less tricky than the Light element is – Shadowelements cannot create illusions, and do not have any natural way to weaponize 
                    47
                    darkness the way a Light-element can weaponize light as a laser or blinding flash.
                    Basically, the Light element can cause people to see things that aren’t there, and
                    the Shadow element can cause people to not see things that are there. They can
                    create zones of near-absolute darkness even under very bright conditions, and
                    can impede or frustrate somebody’s ability to see by scattering pre-existing light.
                    Combining these two applications allows Shadow-elements to become almost
                    entirely invisible in dim lighting, as they can darken themselves and the space
                    around them to avoid standing out, and then blur the area to disguise the fact that
                    the darkness is unnatural – while a Shadow-element operating in daylight will
                    always be quite conspicuous (as using absorption powers on photons before they
                    hit a solid surface will cause people to see a very strange-looking space of absolute
                    darkness), during the night they can make sure that they’re always just out of sight.
                    This is as close to “true” invisibility as any element can get – while a Light-element
                    can hide themselves in daylight by bending light around them, they require a very
                    rigid amount of space to do this, and somebody near them, or an object passing
                    into the controlled light will render them visible. Shadow-elements can go unseen
                    through almost any darkness, anywhere. On top of this, a Shadow-element’s zone
                    of intuitive control does not require a line of sight, meaning that it is essentially
                    impossible to surprise them in low-light conditions.
                    Shadow-elements are quiet, intuitive introverts who are quite good at
                    figuring out when something is wrong with somebody. Like Light-elements, they
                    shun leadership roles in favour of supporting those around them, but they instead
                    of motivating people they often prefer to comfort them. They firmly believe that
                    humans are inclined to periods of necessary inaction, and would rather help
                    people affected by a problem than fix the problem itself. They are often extremely
                    kind, well-meaning, and giving people, but if they aren’t careful they can forget
                    the value of fixing problems and become resigned to their perpetual existence,
                    making them gloomy and fatalistic. They can be so conflict-averse that they will
                    quietly endure easily fixable problems, rather than tell somebody what the
                    problem is. Unsurprisingly, they manifest healing and empathic auxiliary powers
                    more than any other element. 6% of elementalists are Shadow-elements, as is the
                    case with Light. </p>
