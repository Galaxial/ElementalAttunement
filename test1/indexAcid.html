                <p>The Acid element is something of a misnomer – it can
                    control substances with both very high and very low pH
                    values with equal ease/discomfort. It is predisposed to
                    controlling substances that are liquid at median
                    temperature, though with enough skill an Acidelement can also control solid acids. Unlike other
                    coarse manipulation elements, Acid-elements do
                    not target a particular chemicals – while an Acidelement cannot control water normally, a water-based
                    solution with a very high/low pH could theoretically be
                    controlled. Acid-elements typically control substances with pH
                    values above 12.5 or below 1.5. Stronger Acid-elements can control
                    substances with more neutral pH values if they exert more energy, though nobody
                    has ever demonstrated the ability to control substances with pH values between
                    3 and 11.
                    Since substances with extreme pH values are not found very commonly
                    in nature, Acid-elements typically have to carry chemical containers with them.
                    Furthermore, since Acid-elements have an easier time controlling substances the
                    closer to the extremes of the pH scale it gets, they are often limited to being able
                    to manipulate a handful of extremely destructive chemicals. This has earned the
                    element a reputation as having no real nonviolent applications – though some
                    chemists do find it useful around labs, there are probably less than 500 people
                    employed this way out of a total world population of somewhere around 12
                    million Acid-elements. The only well-established ability Acid-elements can
                    demonstrate beyond levitating, concentrating, or diluting extreme-pH chemicals
                    is prevent reactions that would otherwise occur when they come in contact with
                    things like skin, for example. This means that they can, with a bit of training, stick
                    their hand in a bucket of concentrated battery acid and come out with nary an
                    itch. They can control quite a lot of acid at once as well – probably more acid
                    than you could ever reasonably be expected to have in one place.
                    Acid-elements are typically introverts prone to strong bursts of emotion,
                    who prioritize quick, decisive action and can’t abide laziness or anything they
                    might perceive as a noncommittal attitude. At their best, they can be hardworking,
                    introspective people, often possessing a quiet kind of charisma. At their worst,
                    they can be vindictive, judgemental, and moody, prone to taking offense at things
                    without explaining what it was that offended them. Acid-elements tend to manifest 
                    30
                    auxiliary powers that deal with movement in some way, such as short-range
                    teleportation. It is an uncommon element, accounting for about 3% of
                    elementalists</p>
