                <p>The Lava element is the inverse of the Ice element. Ice cools things
                    down, Lava heats them up. Ice can only control solids, Lava can only
                    control liquids. Ice is predisposed to controlling things that are liquid
                    near or below the median temperature, while Lava is
                    predisposed to controlling things that are solid near or
                    above the median temperature. Consequently, Lavaelements in combat rely primarily on melting down
                    whatever they can get their hands on, and then throwing
                    that melted rock/metal/whatever at whoever they want
                    out of their way.
                    Lava-elements have a dual focus much like Ice-elements do,
                    except they focus on transforming things into hotter things and manipulating
                    those hot things. They have a range and a maximum weight that are similar to, if
                    not identical to, Ice’s range/max weight. Lava does have some idiosyncrasies,
                    though – combustion of any kind interferes with their ability to control things,
                    which means they best direct their powers at things that will melt before they burst
                    into flames. Fortunately, unlike Ice, Lava-elements have no problems using their
                    powers on things like stone and metal, which they can melt down very quickly –
                    often in mere seconds.
                    Lava-elements are typically stoic, reserved people, capable of preserving
                    under extremely unpleasant circumstances. At their best, they are determined,
                    loyal, and giving – they don’t often place all that much value on their own
                    possessions, and maintaining their own integrity is of paramount importance to
                    them. If they aren’t careful, they can develop a bit of a martyr complex, or may 
                    33
                    come across as moody, standoffish, or just boring. Lava elements often develop
                    close-range sensory powers, and are rarer than Ice-elements, accounting for about
                    4% of all elementalists.
