                <p>Metal controls naturally solid conductive minerals under
                    about the same conditions that Earth can control nonconductive minerals – too hot or too cold and the
                    Elementalist will have to exert increasingly
                    demanding levels of energy to maintain control. As
                    with Earth, the median temperature for control is body
                    temperature, and controlling a non-solid metal at
                    median temperature requires exerting a level of
                    energy equivalent to the level of energy that
                    would be needed to manipulate that metal were
                    it frozen. A typical Metal-element can exert control over metals
                    within 50° C of median temperature, though some have a greater range. This
                    means the average Metal-Element will have a very difficult time controlling roomtemperature mercury, whose freezing point of -38° C puts it 75° C away from
                    median temperature, but will have no trouble controlling liquid gallium, which
                    melts at 29° C.
                    Metal-elements can levitate, throw, bend, and break metal. Talented
                    Metal-elements can change its brittleness and reshape it without having to bend
                    or break it. Metal-elements typically can control between 100 and 400 kg of
                    metal in optimal conditions, with the amount decreasing at range, in
                    temperatures far from the median, and in non-solid states. Metal-elements
                    typically lose the ability to manipulate their element at a distance of 15m.
                    The Metal element tends to manifest in people that are pragmatic and reliable –
                    though, perhaps surprisingly, not inflexible. At their best, Metal-Elements can
                    be efficient and fearless friends. At worst, they can come to see themselves as
                    above the law, or just be quite self-centred. Metal-elements tend to orient
                    themselves towards their friends, but don’t have a difficult time respecting
                    boundaries – ask and they will do it, but don’t expect them to force help upon
                    you. Metal is associated with a variety of auxiliary powers, and is one of the
                    most common elements, accounting for about 7% of elementalists.</p>
