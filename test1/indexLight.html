                <p>The Light element consists of two major
                    components: light emission and light manipulation. A
                    Light-element can produce light anywhere within range
                    (which is typically around 15m) and they can control
                    exactly what this light looks like. All Light-elements
                    have a median frequency around green, and it takes an
                    equal amount of energy to increase or decrease
                    frequencies from here. Because the difference in
                    hertz between green and ultraviolet is smaller
                    than the difference between green and infrared,
                    Light-elements typically have an easier time producing purples and blues than
                    they do reds and oranges – though almost all Light-elements can produce any
                    visible wavelength with ease. They can also produce ultraviolet light, though
                    typically stopping before the near-ultraviolet range. Infrared light can be
                    produced with difficulty. Some Light-elementalists with an unusually high median
                    frequency cannot produce visible red light, though this is typically compensated
                    by an increased capacity for ultraviolet light production. They can produce lights
                    of up to 8000m. They can also redirect light or alter its frequency.
                    These abilities combine to give a Light-element a high degree of control
                    over what somebody sees. They can create incredibly realistic illusions, blindingly
                    bright flashes, or coherent beams. If a Light-element is skilled enough they can
                    increase their light’s coherence to the point where it forms a laser. Elementalists
                    focused on more subtle use of Light often learn to bend light around them,
                    rendering them invisible at a distance. Light-elements can also learn how to direct
                    light from a wide area into their eyes without compromising its organization,
                    allowing them to see at greater distances or in darker conditions. Light-elements
                    have a natural intuitive control of well-lit areas, but the range of their intuitive 
                    46
                    control is both quite small (20m, barely larger than their manipulative range) and
                    also limited by line of sight.
                    Light-elements tend to be outgoing, talkative, and confident. They need
                    groups of people that they can trust, and fear dishonesty – perhaps because they
                    aren’t often good at detecting it. They aren’t inclined to lead, but are nonetheless
                    encouraging and upbeat, and often excel in both moral and practical support.
                    However, they can also be blunt and selfish, and they can have a hard time
                    empathizing with people. Like Shadow-Elements, they commonly manifest the
                    Photonic Solid Lattice auxiliary power, which allows Light-elements to convert
                    areas of extreme, coherent brightness into something that resembles a solid
                    object. When they don’t manifest that auxiliary power, they frequently manifest
                    healing or amplification powers. They are not uncommon, making up about 6%
                    of all elementalists.</p>
