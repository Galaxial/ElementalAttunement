                <p>The Psionic element deals with the manipulation
                    of neural activity, which means that more than any
                    other Biotic element, Psionics runs up against IWC.
                    Since the object of Psionic manipulation exists
                    entirely within the body, and there are few reasons a
                    person would willingly permit a somebody to
                    rummage through their minds, the average Psionicselement has to be content with much less specific
                    information. They can detect general states of minds,
                    encourage or discourage certain emotions, or
                    completely mind-control things that have brains but no
                    pronounced IWC – so, most nonhuman animals. A
                    Psionics-element typically has a practical range of around 30m,
                    but can detect brain activity (but not specific thoughts) at distances approaching
                    500m. They do not need to see a person to do this, which means it’s very hard to
                    sneak up on them.
                    The list of Psionic abilities that a Psionics-element can be reasonably
                    expected to use is still fairly long – they make good lie detectors, they can calm
                    down panicking people, communicate with one-way telepathy provided the
                    subject is willing, and encourage or discourage certain courses of action (though
                    they have to be careful, as most people are at least somewhat aware of when they
                    are using IWC. This means that if the Psionics-element exerts too much effort,
                    the subject will become aware that somebody is attempting to influence their
                    thoughts). Skilled Psionics-elements can cause or cure intense headaches, induce
                    sleepiness, expedite forgetfulness, and, if the target dazed enough to inhibit their
                    IWC, do something that approaches mind control. Psionics-elements lose the
                    ability to control brains within seconds of death, but can quickly search the mind
                    of a corpse if they want. Given the time limit, it’s unlikely that they’ll find much
                    of use.

                    Psionics-elements are difficult to characterize, as being constantly aware
                    of peoples’ emotional states would have a pretty strong impact on anybody – it’s
                    quite unclear if the personality traits associated with them are innate or simply
                    learned through the kinds of experiences that the Psionics element is conducive
                    of. They always want to understand people around them – this makes them kind
                    and attentive people if they have a high opinion of humans, and tremendously
                    manipulative and snobbish if they don’t. They tend to manifest auxiliary powers
                    that are very physical, like creating shields, speed, or teleportation – this is
                    presumably because auxiliary powers that are subtle and mind-oriented are
                    already sourced from the Psionics element, precluding their use. They are
                    uncommon but not altogether rare, making up about 4% of the world’s
                    elementalists.
