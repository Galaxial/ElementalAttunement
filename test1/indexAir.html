                <p>The Air element controls gasses around median
                    temperature. The minimal amount of energy required to
                    manipulate these gasses is at density of about 1.10kg/m3,
                    and extends about .5kg/m3 in both directions – though as
                    usual, skilled elementalists can control much denser or
                    less dense gasses. Air-elements can exert control over
                    matter that is significantly farther away compared to other
                    coarse manipulation elementalists – they have an average range
                    of 70m and some particularly powerful Air-elements retaining
                    some measure of control up to 300m.
                    Air-elements can accelerate and decelerate gasses to
                    create strong gusts of wind, sometimes fast enough to do serious
                    damage. They can, with enough effort, control all manner of gasses – some Airelements have been able to control gasses as dense as chlorine (though no
                    elementalist has demonstrated the coarse ability needed to control tungsten
                    hexafluoride). They can also create small vacuums by increasing and decreasing
                    air. They cannot violate another human’s IWC to any meaningful extent, which
                    means that suffocating somebody by controlling the air inside their lungs is not
                    possible unless the target actively wants it – and the human breathing reflex will
                    force them to stop wanting it pretty fast, no matter what.
                    Air-elements are typically outgoing and carefree, not prone to extensive
                    sentimentality and with no patience for self-pity. This means they can be fun,
                    gregarious, and adaptive, but can also be prone to fickleness, rash decisionmaking, and discomfort with negative emotions – in both themselves and others.
                    They commonly develop flight or density control as auxiliary powers, and</p>
