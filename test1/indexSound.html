                <p>The Sound element creates, stops, or alters very
                    small vibrations. While these waves do not strictly
                    have to be within audible frequencies, most Soundelements can only exert power over waves in a
                    frequency range audible to the human ear. Unlike
                    Coarse Elements, where the median temperature is fixed
                    to the body temperature of the elementalist, the median
                    frequency of Sound is fixed for each Sound-element under all
                    conditions, but varies from individual to individual. Typically, it’s found
                    somewhere in the 10kHz range, though it is sometimes as low as 1kHz or as high
                    as 20kHz. The further a sound gets from this median frequency, the more energy
                    it will take to produce/control, with most Sound-elements losing control of
                    frequencies more than 10kHz away from this – given what the median sound is,
                    this generally means that Sound-elements have a much easier time creating low
                    sounds than high ones. They do not have a median amplitude, with a louder
                    signal requiring a proportionally larger effort. Most Sound-elements can create
                    noises as loud as 20dB at close range, and can create voice-level noises quite far
                    away from them – sometimes up to 200m. Like all other elementalists, Soundelements can their element at ranges they can’t actively manipulate, which means
                    it’s completely possible that a Sound-element could eavesdrop on a conversation
                    happening half a kilometre away. While this is unlikely (Sound-elements have a
                    harder time listening at range when there are other noises around them), with
                    enough practice they can process a huge amount of auditory data simultaneously
                    and sift out even the quietest of sounds.
                    Sound-elements can create noises loud enough to temporarily deafen
                    somebody and cause permanent long-term damage. They can silence noises or
                    simply reduce them, which means that Sound-elements can’t really deafen other
                    Sound-elements without exerting a drastically superior amount of energy. They
                    can detect the faintest of sounds, and some can use this to create a personal kind 
                    42
                    of sonar. Some Sound-elements with a particular gift for creating strong signals
                    can create noises that are loud and low enough to shake or even damage solid
                    objects. They can intuitively identify frequencies, which means that they can both
                    tune guitars perfectly without a tuner, and get really, really annoyed by
                    instruments that are even slightly out of tune.
                    Sound-elements are often quiet, and not just out of necessity – while they
                    need quiet to use their powers effectively, they also tend to get overwhelmed by
                    groups of people, and especially by groups of people they don’t know. They have
                    a tendency to be patient and attentive people who love to help others, but they
                    can also become extremely suspicious of people who don’t accept – or sometimes
                    even ask for – their help. They are, at their best, kind and reasonable people, and
                    at their worst, they can be paranoid or needy. Sound-elements tend to manifest
                    auxiliary powers that create or influence other objects – shieling is common, as is
                    repairing or healing. They are not entirely uncommon, accounting for 5% of
                    elementalists.</p>
