                <p>The Spirit element is the rarest element and is not well understood. It
                    seems to be able to control things across the planar boundary, because it reacts
                    strongly to HEA nodes, and especially strongly to people with elemental powers.
                    A Spirit-Element has an intuitive ability to identify people with powers, and the
                    more powerful the person, the greater the distance at which they can be sensed.
                    The Spirit element can cause shadowy figures to manifest. They can “direct”
                    these figures, though not in the sense that an Earth-element could direct a rock –
                    it’s more like “suggesting.” They can interact with living things, and can interact
                    with people that have elemental powers much more easily. A Spirit element can
                    use them to obstruct HEA nodes, which can inhibit an elementalists powers. The
                    Spirit-element’s indirect control of these figures functions as a kind of IWC
                    workaround, as they can act on others’ bodies without difficulty. It’s possible that
                    Spirit is less a Quasi-Element and more a kind of “transplanar biotic element” –
                    Blood controls the body, Psionics controls the mind, and Spirit controls the HEA
                    nodes. This would explain why the Spirit element works best on other
                    elementalists, and provides a possible explanation for the shadowy figures: they
                    are inhabitants of the Elemental Plane that are being controlled from
                    the Terrestrial Plane.
                    Spirit-elements tend to be more social than the
                    other Quasi-elements, but other than this, they don’t
                    have very many easily definable trends in personality
                    characteristics. They all report a feeling of distance
                    from their own element – they don’t feel like they
                    control it, they just suggest what it should do. There
                    isn’t much data to extrapolate trends in auxiliary
                    powers from. They make up just .3% of
                    elementalists.</p>
