                <p>The Void element generates a kind black
                    energy with extreme destructive potential. This
                    black energy pulls things towards it, but can only
                    be created in open air. The Void-element is also
                    quite affected by IWC, so even if the Voidelement has considerable range, they will not be
                    able to create this energy near another person
                    who doesn’t want it to be there – and, given
                    what it does, nobody will want it to be there.
                    A Void-element has an average range of 15-
                    20m, and can create larger amounts of this
                    energy the closer they are to it. The Void
                    element is also extremely taxing to use and
                    notoriously finicky – losing focus can disrupt it, moving can
                    disrupt it, using auxiliary powers will always disrupt it – and on top of that, it
                    requires a lot of energy. This means that many Void-elements have trouble
                    maintaining HEA equilibrium, which is doubly problematic because the Voidelement will cause negative side effects pretty much immediately for anybody who
                    attempts a non-elemental energy transfer to keep it going.
                    Void-elements are typically withdrawn and cold, though they are not
                    necessarily amoral – it’s just that most of them are plagued by a feeling of
                    apartness that they can never quite pinpoint the source of. They are rarely people
                    of happy mediums, and oftentimes prioritize extreme courses of action simply
                    because they are extreme. At their best, they can be decisive, introspective people
                    willing to take on very difficult jobs. At worst, they can be dispassionate,
                    humourless, and self-serious. They’re almost never imposing people, and hate
                    asking for favours. There isn’t enough data on them to make a generalization
                    about the kinds of auxiliary powers that they manifest. They make up .5% of
                    elementalists.</p>
