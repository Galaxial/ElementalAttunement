                <p>The Ice element focuses on making things cold,
                    and controlling cold things. An Ice-element is capable
                    of lowering the temperature of any object, and capable
                    of exerting further control over that object once it is
                    cold enough – though the exact conditions under which
                    an object qualifies as “cold enough” are a bit more
                    complicated. The most obvious restriction is that, while an Ice-element can cool
                    off anything, they can only manipulate solids, no matter the temperature – an Iceelement can manipulate water ice at -1°C, but can’t manipulate liquid oxygen at -
                    182°C. Furthermore, Ice-elements have a strong predisposition to controlling
                    substances that have a freezing point close to body temperature, and have a
                    difficult time exerting control over solid substances with high melting points even
                    if they are very cold. Finally, Ice-elements require exponentially greater levels of
                    energy to cool very cold things or very hot things – which means that while
                    freezing water is easy, they aren’t likely to force anything down to absolute zero.
                    The point at which an Ice-element has the least difficult controlling something is
                    when it’s at its freezing point. Combine all these restrictions, and the Ice element
                    finds itself primarily concerned with freezing things that are liquid at median
                    temperature and have a freezing point not far below that. An Ice-element can
                    theoretically control any object if it’s really cold, but the chances of getting
                    something like a metal cold enough to offset the difficulty caused by its high
                    melting point.
                    Ice-elements have a dual focus on the transformative aspect of their
                    power (cooling things) and the manipulative aspect of their power (moving cold 
                    32
                    things). Because the list of things that an Ice-element can reasonably control is
                    quite short, they often work with other non-Ice-elements. They typically have a
                    very short range (often controlling Ice at less than 10m and cooling things at less
                    than 1m), but within that range their abilities can be quite strong. They can learn
                    how to compromise structures by repeatedly freezing them, and can cause
                    immense damage to technology through similar means.
                    Ice-elements are typically shy, cautious people, and are oftentimes almost
                    unnervingly polite. At their best, they can be kind, meticulous, and insightful, but
                    if they don’t push themselves, they can also easily become weak-willed, fearful
                    shut-ins. Ice is associated with a number of long-range sensory powers, and is a
                    fairly common element, accounting for 6% of the total elementalist population</p>
