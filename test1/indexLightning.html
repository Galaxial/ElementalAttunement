                <p>The Lightning element is one of several elements
                    that deal with electromagnetic forces, and is by far the
                    most common of them. Lightning-elements can generate
                    an electric field, and direct electric currents. The exact
                    limitations of the Lightning element are more
                    complicated, however. Lightning-elements can
                    generate electromagnetic fields of varying strength,
                    with most being able to create fields that well exceed the
                    breakdown voltage of air. They can also use their power to create
                    electric arcs, though IWC prevents them from doing this inside the body of
                    another person. This doesn’t mean that they can’t shock people, though – just
                    that they need to exert more energy to push an electrical current “off-course” and
                    send it through somebody. Lightning-elements can typically create around 300kV
                    of electricity, which is enough to bridge a 10m gap, though many can generate
                    more if they aren’t focused on sending it somewhere.
                    Lightning-elements can create brief electrostatic discharges, or maintain
                    sustained currents inside them. They can conduct currents that they have not
                    produced through themselves without harm – though no Lightning-element can
                    do this with an infinitely strong current. Most Lightning-elements can redirect a
                    number of amperes quite a bit higher than the number that they could produce
                    themselves – though if they are currently using their powers to channel a current
                    through themselves, increasing the amperes of the current can cause them to
                    quickly exceed their limits and suffer an electric shock like a normal person. IWC
                    reduces the effectiveness of Lightning as a weapon, though every Lightningelement can produce enough electricity to stun at range, and some can do serious
                    damage or kill. Lightning-elements can sustain an electric arc for a very brief time
                    (typically less than a second) but can sustain a current within themselves for
                    significantly longer. If the current is low enough, they can do this nigh-indefinitely,
                    or while simultaneously creating electric arcs.
                    Lightning-elements are typically outgoing and agreeable, sometimes to
                    the point of being irritating. They typically fear boredom above all else, and can, 
                    34
                    if not careful, tend towards recklessness or hedonism. Lightning-elements can
                    manifest a variety of powers, but tend towards those that can be used on other
                    people willingly. They are quite common, making up about 7% of all
                    elementalists</p>
