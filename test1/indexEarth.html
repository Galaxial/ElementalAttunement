                <p>Earth controls naturally solid non-conductive
                    minerals – if a mineral could conduct electricity at
                    absolute zero, then the Earth element cannot control
                    it. The particular conditions of the minerals controlled
                    must rest well below the object’s melting point but well
                    above absolute zero. In this sense, it can be viewed as
                    part of a spectrum with the Ice and Lava elements,
                    which control very hot substances and very cold
                    substances respectively.
                    Talented Earth-elements can fling boulders or smash them
                    into sand, feel pressure exerted against any rock in the area (for
                    example, footsteps), and talented Earth-elements can typically control up to 1500
                    kg of at once, with the amount decreasing as the Earth gets further from the
                    elementalist, with most Earth-elements losing control at around 12m. The Earth
                    element generally can be controlled by elementalists if it is within 80° C of their
                    body temperature, though strong elementalists can control it beyond that range.
                    The Earth element also gets more difficult to control the less dense it is. Median
                    weight is around 600kg, which means some Earth-elements will find it difficult to
                    control very light objects.
                    The Earth element tends to manifest in people with committed,
                    forthright personalities. Earth elements are often quite shameless – this can
                    manifest as strong ethical convictions that resist peer pressure well,
                    monomaniacal pursuit of a particular interest with no regard for how socially
                    acceptable it is, and sometimes as plain stubbornness. It is commonly associated
                    with strength auxiliary powers, which occur in Earth-elements at a high rate. It is 
                    26
                    one of the most common elements, making up about 8% of the total elementalist
                    population.
