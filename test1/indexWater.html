                <p>The Water element controls water. This should come as no surprise. It
                    controls water best around median temperature, which should not
                    come as a surprise either. Median temperature is not a temperature
                    that water is typically found at – fortunately, they can control it
                    effectively till just below freezing, or around 20°C below the
                    boiling point. Water also has an idiosyncratic way of
                    interacting with the state of the matter it’s controlling
                    – it wants to control liquid, and, as mentioned,
                    virtually all of its temperature range is above
                    freezing/below boiling, but it has a kind of “secondary range”
                    which extends well outside the range where it can be effectively
                    controlled. In this range, attempting to control the water will
                    instead pull it closer to median temperature– a Water-element
                    who is controlling ice will find that the ice is melting, and a Water-element
                    controlling steam will find that the steam is condensing. They also have an
                    exceptional range which can reach up to 100m, and can also control a very large
                    amount of water at once – sometimes over a metric ton.
                    Water-elements can create waves, propel themselves through water,
                    force water molecules close enough together that it becomes possible to walk
                    across it, draw liquid water out of the air, or simply blast people with fire-hosestrength jets. Some Water-elements who are particularly skilled at fine
                    manipulation can break it down into oxygen, which they can then breath in order
                    to stay underwater for much, much longer than normal. Not indefinitely, though
                    – breathing pure oxygen for a long time is generally a bad idea. They can also use
                    their coarse control to counteract water pressure, allowing them to dive much
                    deeper than normal, and to resurface without fear of decompression sickness.
                    Water-elements are typically amicable, extroverted, and calm people
                    who value adaptability and growth. At their best, they can be charismatic and
                    driven without ever becoming unapproachable or arrogant. If they’re not careful,
                    they can become demanding and dour, and they are more prone than most to get
                    frustrated by people or systems that they find resistant to change. Water is
                    associated with a wide array of auxiliary powers, and is one of the most common
                    elements and the most common coarse manipulation element, making up more
                    than 8% of the elementalist population</p>
